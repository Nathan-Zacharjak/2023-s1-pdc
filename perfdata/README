This folder contains all output of all timing tests for the
histogram program.

The program was run for data sizes:
500
500,000
500,000,000
and
5,000,000,000

Each time, the program was given 1, 2, then 4 cores to run,
resulting in 3 output files per test, one for each no. of 
cores.

Each test was run 3 times, resulting in a total of 9 test 
files for each data size number.

The program was complied and run on the university ssh system, using the commands:

mpicc -g -Wall -std=c11 -o histogram histogram.c
to compile

mpiexec histogram -n [core number] < params > ./perfdata/core[core number]data[data size][test number]
to run for each test

A 2 or 3 on the end of the file name denotes the test number, the first tests don't have a number on the end.
So the 3 tests for 1 core and a data size of 500 are:
core1data500
core1data5002
core1data5003
